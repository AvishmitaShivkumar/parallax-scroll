                <h2>What is parallax scrolling?</h2>
                <p class="text">Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance. The technique grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s.</p>
                <h2>Parallax scrolling in Web design</h2>
                <p class="text">One of the first implementations of parallax scrolling in the browser was created and shared in a blog post by web developer Glutnix in 2007, this included example code and a demo using JavaScript and CSS 2 that supported Internet Explorer 6 and other browsers of that era. However, it wasn't until 2011 and the introduction of HTML5 and CSS 3 coding that the technique became popular with Web designers.</p>
